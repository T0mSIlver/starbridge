# Starbridge protocol, version 1

The server stores and relays ciphertext. Everything clients trust is signed, and the code that
signs, seals and verifies lives in `packages/protocol`; its JSON test vectors in
`packages/protocol/vectors` pin the byte formats for the Kotlin client. This file covers what the
code cannot show: the HTTP API and the flows.

## Formats

- Binary values are base64url without padding. Times are ISO 8601.
- **Signed envelope** `{v, kind, signer, body, sig}`: `body` is JSON text kept exactly as signed;
  `sig` is Ed25519 over `"starbridge/v1/<kind>" NUL signer NUL body`. Verifiers check the
  signature before they parse `body`.
- **Sealed item** `{v, kind, id, from, re?, boxes: [{to, box}]}`: a signed envelope sealed with
  `crypto_box_seal` to each recipient. `kind`, `id`, `from`, `re` and `to` are routing hints for
  the server; clients reject an item whose hints disagree with the signed body.
- Decisions and quota snapshots are signed by a machine and sealed to every active device.
  Answers are signed by a device and sealed to the asking machine.

## Directory

The account's directory is a hash chain of signed entries listing each member's X25519 and
Ed25519 public keys. Entry 0 adds the first device, names the recovery public key, and is signed
both by that device and by the recovery key (`recoverySig`). Each later entry carries `seq` and `prev` (BLAKE2b-256 of the previous
entry's body), and is signed by an active device or by the recovery key. Machines sign no
entries; the recovery key adds only devices. Revoking is an entry too.

Clients replay the chain with `verifyDirectory` and keep a pin `{length, head}`. A later fetch
must extend the pin, so the server can neither insert a key, nor roll back a revocation, nor serve
a chain of its own.

## Pairing

A new member (a machine, or a second device) makes its keys and shows a 24-character code: 8
characters of rendezvous id, then 16 characters (80 bits) of secret that never reach the server.
Both pairing messages carry an HMAC (`crypto_auth`) keyed from the secret.

1. The new member posts its request (role, id, name, public keys) under the rendezvous id.
2. The owner types the code on a device. The device checks the request's MAC, appends an `add`
   entry for those exact keys, and posts an approval `{account, length, head}` with its MAC.
3. The new member checks the approval's MAC, verifies the directory with `{length, head}` as its
   pin, and checks that the directory holds its own keys.

A code expires after 10 minutes. The server could brute-force the secret offline from a MAC, but
80 bits take far longer than that.

## Recovery

The first device shows a 32-byte recovery seed once, as 24 BIP-39 words. When every device is
lost, a new device turns the words into the recovery key pair, verifies the chain with that
public key (entry 0's `recoverySig` must check against it, which a copied public key cannot
fake), and signs its own `add` entry with it.

## HTTP API

Base path `/v1`. JSON bodies. Errors are `{error, detail?}` with an HTTP status; protocol
errors use the codes in `packages/protocol/src/sodium.ts`.

### Auth

- **Devices** sign in with GitHub (hosted) or the owner token from the server's environment
  (self-hosted). The web page holds an HTTP-only session cookie; Android sends
  `Authorization: Bearer <session>`. A session belongs to an account and, once paired, to one
  device member id.
- **Machines** send `Authorization: Bearer <machine token>`, issued when their pairing is
  approved. The server stores a hash of it and drops it when the directory revokes the machine.
- Pairing requests are unauthenticated and rate-limited per IP.
- A session gets its device when that session writes the directory's first entry, or a
  recovery-signed `add`, or fetches its own pairing result (a new device signs in first).
  Revoking a device ends its sessions; revoking a machine drops its token.

| Route | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /auth/github` | anyone | start GitHub sign-in |
| `GET /auth/github/callback` | anyone | finish it, set the session; with `?app=1` on the start, redirect to `starbridge://auth#session=<token>` instead |
| `POST /auth/owner` | anyone | self-hosted: `{token}` against `OWNER_TOKEN`; sets the session and returns `{session}` |
| `POST /auth/logout` | device | end the session |
| `GET /me` | device, machine | `{account, member, role}`; `member` is null until a device pairs |

### Directory

| Route | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /directory?from=<seq>` | device, machine | `{entries}` from `seq` on |
| `POST /directory` | device | append `{entry}`; 409 unless its `seq` is the next one; 403 `machine-cap` past the account's machine limit (5 on the hosted server) |

The server runs `verifyDirectory` before it accepts an entry, to refuse garbage early. Clients
never rely on that check.

### Pairing

| Route | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /pairings` | new member | `{request, claimHash}`: the request message and BLAKE2b-256 of a random claim secret's text (`claimHash`); 409 if the rendezvous id is taken |
| `GET /pairings/:rendezvous` | device | `{request}` |
| `POST /pairings/:rendezvous/approve` | device | `{approval}`; the directory must already hold the new member's entry; 409 `already-paired` when that member already holds a session or token |
| `GET /pairings/:rendezvous/result?wait=<s>` | new member, with `X-Claim: <secret>` | long-poll: `{approval, token?}` once approved, `token` for machines only; 204 when `wait` passes |

### Items

| Route | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /items` | machine (decision, quota), device (answer) | store a sealed item and push it to each recipient; 409 on a reused id |
| `GET /items?kind=<kind>&after=<cursor>` | device | items with only the caller's box, and `cursor` |
| `GET /items/:id` | device, machine | one item, the caller's box only; push points here when the item exceeds 4 KB |
| `GET /quota` | device | the latest quota item from each machine |

Item ids are random, chosen by the sender. Cursors are opaque strings; without `after`, a list
starts at the first item. An answer's `re` marks its decision answered, so every
device moves it out of the open inbox.

Lists return `{items: [{item, cursor, receivedAt, answeredAt?}], cursor}`, 100 at a time, where
`item` holds only the caller's box and `answeredAt` is set on answered decisions. An answer moves
its decision past every cursor, so devices listing after their cursor see it again, answered.
The server keeps only the latest quota item from each machine. Refusals: 403 when the caller's
role may not post this kind or `from` is not the caller; 400 `unknown-recipient` when a box goes
to anyone but active devices (decision, quota) or the asking machine (answer); 409
`already-answered`.

### Answers for machines (long-poll)

`GET /answers?after=<cursor>&wait=<seconds>` (machine). The server replies at once with
`{items, cursor}` when answers addressed to the machine came after `cursor`, else holds the request
until one arrives or `wait` (at most 300) passes and replies `{items: [], cursor}`. The Claude Code
mod keeps one such request open and re-opens it on every reply; the CLI's `wait` does the same.
A machine checks that an answer's `decisionId` is one it asked and its `choice` one of the
decision's options.

### Push

| Route | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /push/subscriptions` | device | `{type: "fcm" \| "webpush" \| "unifiedpush", endpoint, keys?}` → `{id}`; URL endpoints must be public HTTPS |
| `DELETE /push/subscriptions/:id` | device | stop pushing there |
| `GET /push/vapid` | anyone | `{publicKey}`: the VAPID key a browser subscribes with (the relay's when this server forwards Web Push) |
| `POST /relay` | another server | relay mode only: `{type: "fcm" \| "webpush", endpoint, keys?, payload}` → `{result: "ok" \| "gone" \| "failed" \| "no-route"}`; rate-limited per IP |

A push payload is JSON text: `{v, kind, id, from, re?, box?}` for a new item, with the device's
own box when the payload stays within 3 KB, else without it and the device fetches
`GET /items/:id`; `{v, kind: "answered", id}` to every device a decision was sealed to once it
is answered. FCM gets it as data field `p`; Web Push and UnifiedPush encrypt it per RFC 8291.

A server with FCM credentials or VAPID keys pushes directly. One without them posts to the relay
set in `RELAY_URL` (the owner's hosted server runs with `RELAY_MODE=1`), which pushes with its
own credentials; the payload is already ciphertext or an id. UnifiedPush always goes direct.
`gone` from a push service drops the subscription.
